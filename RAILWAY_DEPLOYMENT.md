# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Checklist for SMILEY

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Files Added
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- [x] `app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
- [x] `next.config.js` - Updated for Railway optimization
- [x] `.railwayignore` - Exclude unnecessary files
- [x] `railway.env.template` - Environment variables template

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to Git Repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment files"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Via Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub/GitLab
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Select your SMILEY repository
6. Wait for automatic detection and build

#### Option B: Via Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```env
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# Optional (if using Stripe)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
- Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- Test main page: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- Check Railway logs for any errors

## ðŸ”§ Railway-Specific Features

### Health Check
- Railway will monitor `/api/health` endpoint
- Automatic restarts if health check fails
- 300-second timeout for health checks

### Build Optimization
- `output: 'standalone'` for better containerization
- Automatic dependency installation
- Optimized build process for Next.js

### Auto-Scaling
- Automatic scaling based on traffic
- Global CDN for fast loading
- Edge function support (if enabled)

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- Real-time deployment logs
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Resource usage

### Health Monitoring
- Automatic health checks every 30 seconds
- Email notifications for failures
- Easy rollback to previous versions

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check Railway logs for dependency issues
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required vars are set
3. **Port Conflicts**: Railway automatically assigns ports
4. **Memory Issues**: Check resource limits in Railway dashboard

### Debug Commands
```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Check Railway status
railway status

# Restart deployment
railway restart
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!
Your SMILEY website will be live at: `https://your-app.railway.app`
