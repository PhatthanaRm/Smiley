# SMILEY Shopping Functionality Test Guide

## üõí How to Test Shopping Functionality

Your SMILEY e-commerce site is actually working! Here's how to test it:

### 1. Basic Cart Functionality (Works Without API Keys)

**Test the cart locally:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/shop
2. Click "Add to Cart" on any product
3. You should see a success toast notification
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/cart
5. You should see the product in your cart
6. Try updating quantities and removing items

**What works without API keys:**
- ‚úÖ Product browsing
- ‚úÖ Adding items to cart
- ‚úÖ Cart management (add/remove/update quantities)
- ‚úÖ Cart persistence (items stay in cart on page refresh)
- ‚úÖ Cart calculations (subtotal, shipping, tax)
- ‚úÖ Promo codes (try "smiley10" for 10% off)

### 2. What Requires API Keys

**Checkout process needs Stripe:**
- ‚ùå Proceeding to checkout (requires Stripe API keys)
- ‚ùå Payment processing (requires Stripe API keys)
- ‚ùå User authentication (requires Supabase API keys)
- ‚ùå Wishlist functionality (requires Supabase API keys)

### 3. Quick Test Steps

1. **Open your browser** and go to http://localhost:3000/shop
2. **Add products to cart:**
   - Click "Add to Cart" on "Mango Tango Toothpaste" ($8.99)
   - Click "Add to Cart" on "Strawberry Soft Brush" ($12.99)
3. **View your cart:**
   - Click the cart icon in the header or go to http://localhost:3000/cart
   - You should see both items with correct prices
4. **Test cart features:**
   - Update quantities using +/- buttons
   - Remove items using the trash icon
   - Try the promo code "smiley10" for 10% discount
5. **Test persistence:**
   - Refresh the page - items should still be there
   - Close and reopen browser - items should still be there

### 4. Expected Behavior

**‚úÖ Working:**
- Products display correctly
- Add to cart shows success toast
- Cart updates in real-time
- Cart persists across sessions
- Price calculations are correct
- Promo codes work
- Responsive design

**‚ùå Not working (needs API keys):**
- Checkout button redirects to error
- User sign-in/sign-up
- Wishlist functionality
- Order processing

### 5. Troubleshooting

**If "Add to Cart" doesn't work:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Look for JavaScript errors related to cart

**If cart is empty after adding items:**
1. Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
2. Try in a different browser
3. Check for JavaScript errors

**If checkout fails:**
- This is expected without Stripe API keys
- You'll need to set up Stripe to test payments

### 6. Next Steps

To enable full shopping functionality:

1. **Set up Stripe** (for payments):
   - Create account at https://stripe.com
   - Get API keys from dashboard
   - Add to `.env.local` file

2. **Set up Supabase** (for user accounts):
   - Create account at https://supabase.com
   - Create new project
   - Get API keys from project settings
   - Add to `.env.local` file

3. **Create `.env.local` file** with your API keys

4. **Restart the development server**
